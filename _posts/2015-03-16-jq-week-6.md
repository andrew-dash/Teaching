### Applying What We've Learned

Functions and app structure will help to future proof jQuery and Javascript code.

jQuery Methods:

    .width() // element width
    .innerWidth() // includes padding, but not border or margins
    .outerWidth() // full outside element width
    .height() // element height
    .innerHeight() // includes padding, but not border or margins
    .outerHeight() // full outside element height

We'll look at how to calculate image heights dynamically and apply margins/padding according to the images.

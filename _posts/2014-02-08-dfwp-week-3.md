###Child Themes

Child themes are extremely useful and a really great way to hack on a theme without the fear of breaking any features or functionality. Using a child theme will allow us to add features like new styles or page templates. Child themes are huge time savers when developing multiple themes/ sites. One way to approach a child theme would be to develop a rock solid base theme and use child themes to add unique features/ styles. 

Child themes are easy to implement; they only require one file: style.css

We'll begin by creating a new folder in the themes directory. Create a new folder for your child theme. If you're creating a child theme for the twentyfourteen theme it would probably be best to name the child theme twentyfourteen-child.

Create a style.css file insid this new child theme folder. Inside the stylesheet there are a few required lines to include. Again, if making a child theme for the twentyfourteen theme your child theme stylesheet should look like this:

		/*
		 * Theme Name: TwentyFourteen Child
		 * Template: twentyfourteen
		 */
		 @import url("../twentyfourteen/style.css");

That's it! You can now edit the child theme stylesheet or add php files to customize your theme. Wordpress will use the parent theme files first, then make any overrides if such are present in the child theme. The only file that this does not apply to is functions.php.

### CSS Selectors Best Practices

**Child Selectors**

Use child selectors to select elements that fall within another element. The element inside is the child. These can be selected using descendant or direct child selectors.

**Descendant Slelector**

A selector that chooses any child within the parent element, for example:

<code>section p { ... }</code>

With `p` being the child and `section` being the parent every `p` element within `section` will be selected. In practice:

```
<section>
  <p>This line will be selected</p>
  <div>
    <p>This line will be selected</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

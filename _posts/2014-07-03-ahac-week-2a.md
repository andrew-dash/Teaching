### CSS Selectors Best Practices

**Child Selectors**

Use child selectors to select elements that fall within another element. The element inside is the child. These can be selected using descendant or direct child selectors.

**Descendant Selectors** choose any child within the parent element, for example:

<code>section p { ... }</code>

With `p` being the child and `section` being the parent every `p` element within `section` will be selected. In practice:

```
<section>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Direct Child Selectors** chose only the direct children of the parent element. Switching the previous example to use this method we use the following:

<code>section > p { ... }</code>

Now any elements outside the `section` element or nested inside other elements will not be selected. 

```
<section>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This line will NOT be selected because it is not a direct child.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Sibling Selectors**

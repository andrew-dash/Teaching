### CSS Selectors Best Practices

**Child Selectors**

Use child selectors to select elements that fall within another element. The element inside is the child. These can be selected using descendant or direct child selectors.

**Descendant Selectors** choose any child within the parent element, for example:

<code>section p { ... }</code>

With `p` being the child and `section` being the parent every `p` element within `section` will be selected. In practice:

```
<section>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Direct Child Selectors** chose only the direct children of the parent element. Switching the previous example to use this method we use the following:

<code>section > p { ... }</code>

Now any elements outside the `section` element or nested inside other elements will not be selected. 

```
<section>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This line will NOT be selected because it is not a direct child.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Sibling Selectors**

**General Sibling Selectors** choose elements that share a common parent. The `~` character is used to denote general siblings. 

<code>h1 ~ p { ... }</code>

In this example, all `p` elements that follow the `h1` element are siblings and will thus be selected.

```
<section>
  <p>This line will NOT be selected.</p>
  <h1>Parent</h1>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  <div>
  	<p>This line will NOT be selected.</p>
  </div>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
</section>
```

**Adjacent Sibling Selectors** choose elements that directly follow a parent element. The `+` character is used to denote adjacent siblings. 

<code>h1 ~ p { ... }</code>

In this example, all `p` elements that follow the `h1` elements directly are adjacent siblings and will thus be selected.

```
<section>
  <p>This line will NOT be selected.</p>
  <h1>Parent</h1>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
  <div>
  	<p>This line will NOT be selected.</p>
  </div>
  <p>This line will NOT be selected.</p>
  <h1>Parent</h1>
  <p>This line will be selected.</p>
</section>
```

**Pseudo-classes**

Pseudo-classes function like regular classes but they are invoked relative to the actions of the user or the document structure. Pseudo-classes use the `:` character to define actions. Most commonly used, `:hover` specifies an action when the user hovers over the element. 

<code>a:hover { ... }</code>

Here are the most common action-based pseudo-classes:

- one
- two

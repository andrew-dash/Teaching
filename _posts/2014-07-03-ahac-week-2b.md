<h2>Front-End Frameworks</h2>

A front-end framework is a handy colection of well written HTML/CSS/Javasscript files that can be used for rapid site deployment. Beyond a simple CSS grid these frameworks often contain all the features needed for a full front-end build. Two of the best are [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). These are fully featured front-end frameworks. If you prefer a simpler approach, [Kraken](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/) is a great option. Kraken has the simplicity of a boilerplate, like the HTML5 initializr that we've used, but has addons which give it the potential to become a robust framework.

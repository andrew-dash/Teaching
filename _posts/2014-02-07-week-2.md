###Going under the hood of a Wordpress theme

[Bootstrap Wordpress Theme](http://320press.com/wpbs/)

We'll all activate this theme to take a look at how the theme is composed and investigate the different components. 

Using this theme we will:

* See how the various PHP files come together to generate the final output of our site. 
* Learn some basic PHP commands to be able to troubleshoot and/ or make changes or additions to a theme.
* Make changes that are not possible via the Wordpress Dashboard.
* Create new page templates to extend the flexibility of a Wordpress site.

###Homework

Sketch out a plan for a Wordpress theme that you would like to work on. Think about how the site would be laid out -- Start to think about how you would build the wordpress theme. What elements would go in the header, footer, and sidebar? Would you use posts? What types of page layouts would you use? 

We'll start week 2A going over site sketches/plans then begin the process of converting an HTML Site into a fully functioning Wordpress Theme.

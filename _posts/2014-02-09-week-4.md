### Continuing Custom Theme Development

Beginning with a new base HTML5/CSS3 site we will continue to work on building custom WP themes. We'll start from ground 0 again creating a theme by breaking up the HTML site and adding in the necessary WP components. Today's class will consist of a review last week's lesson which will set us up for extending the word press theme to include more components like multiple pages, media, comments, functions, and more.

### Class Files

[Base Demo Site (files)](bin/demoBaseWk4.zip)

[Week 4 Theme Layout (files from class)](bin/wk4Theme.zip)

[Week 4 Theme Layout with single post template (files from class)](bin/wk4Theme2.zip)

## Continuing after class

The new zip file above is basically the same as what we left class with this past week but I've included the code for displaying a single post. Please take a look at the differences and run this code on your WordPress test sites. We are well on our way to becoming WP theme gurus! 

Next class we will look in depth at page-templates dissect an existing theme. Using what we've learned about creating a theme from an HTML site we will look at free themes to see how data flows and begin to think about how we would want our theme to function.

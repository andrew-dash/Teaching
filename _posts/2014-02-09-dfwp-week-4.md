The links below should serve as helpful resources. You certainly DO NOT need to go through everything listed below. I'm providing links to multiple tutorials to illustrate 1. the amount of great resources on the web and 2. the various ways to build a WP theme. 

*   [The Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/)

*   [Wordpress Theme Developer Handbook](http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/)

*   [Theme Development](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development)

### Course Structure

We have established so far that in this course we plan to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress themes. Our goals include:

- Take a basic HTML/CSS site and turn it into a wordpress theme
- Have a working understanding of what it takes to develop and implement a custom WP theme.
- Custom theme development experience and the skills to 'hack' existing themes.
- By the end of class everyone should have a custom theme - either built from scratch or a heavily modified pre-existing theme.
- We'll wrap up with a discussion on where to go next with our new skill set.

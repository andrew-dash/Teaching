### Course Description
Content Management Systems is meant to broaden the student's understanding of servers, back-end development, and website management. In this course we focus on _Jekyll_, a flat-file CMS and static site generator. Through creating a full site in _Jekyll_ students learn the ins and outs of what it takes to create a content management system. From generating a custom site template to implementing a categorized blog system students will generate a skill set that will easily apply to a range of other flat file and database driven CMS options. Covering the pros and cons of a range of CMS platforms students will leave this course with the skills and knowledge to approach any CMS with confidence.

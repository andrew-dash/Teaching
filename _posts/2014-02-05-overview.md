### Course Description

In this course, students learn to create their own web designs in WordPress allowing for everything 
from blog integration to a full-ﬂedged content management system. While working with the 
WordPress template, students create themes that blend their own design vision with WordPress' 
robust functionality. At the end of the course, students will have a website created in WordPress 
according to their own creative vision.

### Course Structure

We have established so far that in this course we plan to learn the ins and outs of Wordpress themes. Our goals include: 

- Take the basic HTML/CSS site and turn it into a wordpress theme by week 3
- Have a working understanding of what it takes to develop and implement a custom WP theme.
- Custom theme development experience and the skills to 'hack' existing themes.
- By the end of class everyone should have a custom theme - either built from scratch or a heavily modified pre-existing theme.
- We'll wrap up with a discussion on where to go next with our new skill set.

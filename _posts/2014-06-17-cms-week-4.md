##Moving forward with Jekyll

Liquid markup can be used to organize posts into dynamic layouts like image galleries with multiple filters. We extended our Jekyll sites to implement an image gallery page. See [mySecondJekyllSite](http://notandrewkaye.github.io/mySecondJekyllSite/imageGallery/) to see it in action. 

We've covered all the tools and techniques necessary to build a full website in Jekyll. Our next step will be to sketch out the layout of a site either found on the web or built by you. With this layout, explain:

* How would the site would be structured to be built in Jekyll? 
* What would go in the `_includes` folder, the `_layouts` folder, and the `_posts` folder? 
* How would the layouts be used? What is the site's scalability implemented with Jekyll?

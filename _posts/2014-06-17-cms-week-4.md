###Prose.io Alternative

[Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is a very nicely done alternative to [Prose](http://prose.io). Dillinger supports not only github integration but other cloud services like [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com), & [Microsoft OneDrive](http://onedrive.live.com).

###Jekyll Plugins

Plugins let you add custom functionality to Jekyll like generating a sitemap or generating pages from the tags or categories being used. 

[Jekyll Plugin List](http://www.jekyll-plugins.com/)


Github pages runs jekyll with the `--safe` option which means only a few plugins will natively work. Some [jekyll plugins work with Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/) :thumbsup:, but to use plugins that you've created or found online follow [this simple guide](http://davidensinger.com/2013/04/deploying-jekyll-to-github-pages/) which steps you through the process of building your jekyll site locally with plugins and still hosting the `_site` dir on gh-pages. 

Sitemap plugin config info:

		sitemap:
		    file: "/sitemap.xml"
		    exclude:
		        - "/im.html"
		    include_posts:
		        - "/index.html"
		    change_frequency_name: "change_frequency"

> JavaScript is a programming language that can be applied to an HTML document and used to create dynamic interactivity on websites.

You can do pretty much anything with JavaScript. We'll start small with simple features such as adjusting layouts, making things happen when buttons are clicked, carousels, and image galleries â€” but eventually as you get more experienced with the language you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, full blown database-driven apps, and more.

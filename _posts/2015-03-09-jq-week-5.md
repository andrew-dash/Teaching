### Building Functions

Functions give you the flexibility to execute a set of commands with one command. They can be used to easily repeat chunks of code or execute multiple commands easily with one line of code. Breaking code up into functions can also help keep things in order and more digestable.

    var myFunction = function() {
        // code goes here
    };

then you can call the function other places in your js file or in other js files with:

    myFunction(); // running this will execute everything within the function.


### Structuring Code

We can structure our code further by executing events in succession. This isn't always necessary, but useful in some instances.

    // declare a new var with the name that you'll use to call it's functions
    // enclosed in the var are a set of functions that can be either called independently or fire in succession
    var app = {
        // Application Constructor
        initialize: function() {
            // declare initial actions / declarations
            this.bindEvents();
        },
        // Bind any events that are required on startup.
        bindEvents: function() {
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', this.onReady, false);
        },
        // executable function
        onReady: function() {
            console.log("I'm ready");
        }
    };

call this with `app.initialize();`

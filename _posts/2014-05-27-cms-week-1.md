###The Rundown
* Course Overview
* Syllabus Review
* General Lecture on Content Management Systems
* Brief intro to Jekyll and Github

By next class everyone should sign up for a free account on [Github.com](http://github.com)

All tools in this course are opensource and free to use. 

Here are some links to tools we'll be using or talking about in the class:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

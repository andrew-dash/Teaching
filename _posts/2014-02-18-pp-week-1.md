We'll plan possible routes to take for building a portfolio, and what everyone would like to accomplish over the next 10 weeks. We'll go through a 5-step process over this 10 week period including: plan, design, sketch, implement, test. 

Special topics to be covered in class include:

- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) / [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/)
- [CSS3 Transitions](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/)
- [HTML5 Features](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- and more!

###For next week: Plan!

- come up with a plan including design themes, framework, backend, and content
- compile your portfolio assets into an easy to access location (this means remembering WP log-in info and where files are located!)

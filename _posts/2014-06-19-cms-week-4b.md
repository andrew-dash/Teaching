###Jekyll Compared to Wordpress

* How is a Wordpress theme similar to a Jekyll Site?
* How is a MySQL Database similar to Jekyll posts?
* What does knowing Jekyll mean for working with Database driven CMS Sites?

Wordpress uses a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

![relationalDB](media/rdb.svg)

Virtually all RDBs use SQL (Structured Query Language)

Newer and faster options are here, however... NoSQL (Not Only SQL) 

One of the best examples is [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), a NoSQL Database option that uses JSON for data storage.

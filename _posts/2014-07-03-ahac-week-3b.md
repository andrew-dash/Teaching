<h2>In-Progress Critiques</h2>

We'll take a look at everyone's sites - sharing feedback and tips. This is a good way to see how others are building out certain features. Ask questions and give constructive feedback. 

###Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)

We'll talk a little bit about [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) as well -> Looking at what it is, how it is implemented, & how it works. Using SASS on an HTML site requires a compiler which, unfortunately we can't run on the school machines. I'll walk through the steps using SASS but if you want to install it for yourself check out this [installation guide](http://sass-lang.com/install).

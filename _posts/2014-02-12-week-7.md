### Theme Customization

In week 7 we went through the process of taking free theme and transforming it to work as a thumbnail gallery with each post being a thumbnail. Beginning with the Codium Grid theme (linked below) we edited index.php, header.php, footer.php, and style.css to bring us to a working modified theme. We used codium's 15 column grid layout to easily style our post's feature images into a 5-up grid with no other text.

##HTML5 Canvas
The `<canvas>` element is a usefeature of HTML5 that allows you to break the standard box model and add virtually anything to a web page. Commonly the canvas is used for games and other interactive features. The canvas uses javascript and has nearly full support across browsers. 

###Wikipedia Description

> Canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with height and width attributes. JavaScript code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to other common 2D APIs, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics. Some anticipated uses of canvas include building graphs, animations, games, and image composition.

###Blank starter:

	<html>
	  <head>
	    <title>Canvas tutorial</title>
	    <script type="text/javascript">
	      function draw(){
	        var canvas = document.getElementById('demo');
	        if (canvas.getContext){
	          var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
	        }
	      }
	    </script>
	    <style type="text/css">
	      canvas { border: 1px solid black; }
	    </style>
	  </head>
	  <body onload="draw();">
	    <canvas id="demo" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
	  </body>
	</html>

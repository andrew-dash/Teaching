##HTML5 Canvas
The `<canvas>` element is a usefeature of HTML5 that allows you to break the standard box model and add virtually anything to a web page. Commonly the canvas is used for games and other interactive features. The canvas uses javascript and has nearly full support across browsers. 

###Wikipedia Description

> Canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with height and width attributes. JavaScript code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to other common 2D APIs, thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics. Some anticipated uses of canvas include building graphs, animations, games, and image composition.

###Blank starter:

	<html>
	  <head>
	    <title>Canvas tutorial</title>
	    <script type="text/javascript">
	      function draw(){
	        var canvas = document.getElementById('demo');
	        if (canvas.getContext){
	          var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
	        }
	      }
	    </script>
	    <style type="text/css">
	      canvas { border: 1px solid black; }
	    </style>
	  </head>
	  <body onload="draw();">
	    <canvas id="demo" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
	  </body>
	</html>

###Drawing with Canvas
Use half pixels to get a crisp exact 1px wide line.

You get a line that looks like this:

![half pixels](media/canvas-half-pixels-2.jpg)

**Drawing a line:**

	var canvas = document.getElementById("demo");
	var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
	ctx.moveTo(10, 10);
	ctx.lineTo(400, 400);
	ctx.strokeStyle = "#ff0000";
	ctx.stroke();

**Draw a rectangle with a gradient:**

	var canvas = document.getElementById("demo");
	var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
	var myGradient = context.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 100, 0);
	myGradient.addColorStop(0, "#cccccc");
	myGradient.addColorStop(1, "#ffffff");
	context.fillStyle = myGradient;
	context.fillRect(25, 25, 125, 125);

Notes:

* instead of running `<body onload="draw();">` you could run `window.onload = draw;` at the beginning of your script in the head.
* You can add fallback content to replace canvas if it is not supported in a certain browser. Just add an img between the canvas open and close tag like this: `<canvas><img src="" alt="fallback img"></canvas>`

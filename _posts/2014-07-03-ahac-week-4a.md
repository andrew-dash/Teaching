###Blank starter:

	<html>
	  <head>
	    <title>Canvas tutorial</title>
	    <script type="text/javascript">
	      function draw(){
	        var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
	        if (canvas.getContext){
	          var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
	        }
	      }
	    </script>
	    <style type="text/css">
	      canvas { border: 1px solid black; }
	    </style>
	  </head>
	  <body onload="draw();">

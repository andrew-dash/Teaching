###Posts, Loops, & Conditionals

Post take a standard format to keep content organized and easy to manage: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

**Loops** are used to check for posts and fill the page with your content. 

A Loop generally looks like this: 

    {% for post in site.posts %}

			<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">
				{{ post.title }} 
			</a>

			<p>{{ post.content }}</p>

	{% endfor %}


Use [Liquid Markup](http://liquidmarkup.org/) to introduce these dynamic elements like a for loop. 

An if statement can be used to customize the way content is displayed. Using tags in the `YAML` header is a great way to filter posts on certain pages. Tags can be added to any post or page by adding a line like: `tag: myTag` to the `YAML` header.

To make certain posts tagged appear on a specific page use an if statement combined with a for loop. It should look something like this:

    {% for post in site.posts %}

		{% if post.tag == "myTag" %}

				<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">
						{{ post.title }} 
				</a>

				<p>{{ post.content }}</p>
				
		{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}

###Posts, Loops, & Conditionals

Post take a standard format to keep content organized and easy to manage: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

**Loops** are used to check for posts and fill the page with your content. 

A Loop generally looks like this:

Use [Liquid Markup](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) to introduce these dynamic elements like a for loop. 

An if statement can be used to customize the way content is displayed. Using tags in the `YAML` header is a great way to filter posts on certain pages. Tags can be added to any post or page by adding a line like: `tag: myTag` to the `YAML` header.

To make certain posts tagged appear on a specific page use an if statement combined with a for loop. It should look something like this:

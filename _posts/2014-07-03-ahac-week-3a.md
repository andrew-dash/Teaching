<h2>Advanced CSS3</h2>

CSS3 **Transitions** and **Transforms**, although not 100% supported by all browsers, provides a quick and simple way to apply functional and sometimes drastic changes to a page's style. 

Transitions and transforms require **vendor prefixes** to properly function across browsers. It is in your best interest to always use these when using these properties. Remember to always place the un-prefixed version last - this overwrites the prefixed versions if the browser supports the property. Here's an example of a fully prefixed transition and transform: 

<pre>
	.box{
		background: #000;
		-webkit-transition: background .3s ease;
  		   -moz-transition: background .3s ease;
  		     -o-transition: background .3s ease;
  		        transition: background .3s ease;
	}

	.box:hover{
		background: #fff;
		-webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
  		   -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
  		     -o-transform: scale(1.5);
  		        transform: scale(1.5);

	}
</pre>

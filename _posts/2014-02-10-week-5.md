### Child Themes

Child themes are extremely useful and a really great way to hack on a theme without the fear of breaking any features or functionality. Using a child theme will allow us to add features like new styles or page templates. Child themes are huge time savers when developing multiple themes/ sites. One way to approach a child theme would be to develop a rock solid base theme and use child themes to add unique features/ styles. 

Picking up where we left off from week 4 we will dive into child themes and go over the steps to implement our first child theme while picking up new skills along the way. 

### Site of the Day

[Theme Forest](http://themeforest.net) is a great resource, but mostly has paid themes. Sometimes paid themes are a great way to go since they are packed with features, but hopefully we'll all be able to stay away from paying for a theme. I chose this site as our site of the day because every month they have a Free File. If you sign up for a free account with Theme Forest you can download each month's free file which often includes Word Press themes for free!

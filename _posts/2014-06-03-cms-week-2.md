###Jekyll, Explained

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

* Technically Jekyll creates sites, it does not serve them. 
* By providing a source including a template Jekyll spits out a site directory which is no different from a static HTML site. 
* Jekyll uses [Liquid Templating](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)
* It uses [YAML](http://yaml.org/spec/1.0/) Headers

Jekyll Description: 
> Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

Sites that use Jekyll:

* [Github Training](http://training.github.com/)

Installing Jekyll

* Jekyll runs using Ruby - We have to set it up in the terminal
* First command is `gem install jekyll`
* Next, `gem install rdiscount`
* Next, `sudo easy_install Pygments`

Jekyll, like static sites we're used to dealing with, uses folders for structure. We begin with three folders: `_includes` `_layout` & `_posts`

We also need a configuration file, `_config.yml`

Type `jekyll` into the terminal (NOTE: you must be in your site's directory) -- you shoukd see a 'complete message'

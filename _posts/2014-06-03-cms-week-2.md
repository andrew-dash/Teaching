###Jekyll, Explained

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

* Technically Jekyll creates sites, it does not serve them. 
* By providing a source including a template Jekyll spits out a site directory which is no different from a static HTML site. 
* Jekyll uses [Liquid Templating](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)
* It uses [YAML](http://yaml.org/spec/1.0/) Headers

Jekyll Description: 
> Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

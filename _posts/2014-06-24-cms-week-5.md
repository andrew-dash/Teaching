##Integrating Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a GUI in-browser editor for posts on Jekyll sites. It uses your github login to access your site and allows you or other users to add new posts, edit existing posts, and execute many other great functions all from within a browser window. No code required. 

The first step is to authenticate your github account with Prose. Once authenticated, you should see your repositories populate within the Prose window. Prose brings the simplicity of an in browser dashboard like Wordpress to your Jekyll site. 

Select your website and browse your folders and posts, you should be able to see the content you've added so far. 

Prose gives you full access to the post's YAML header so you can categorize, tag, and add just about any functionality. 

To get our site set up with Prose we need to add some standard pieces of code to our _config.yml file. Here's what you need to get started:

	prose:
	  rooturl: '_posts'
	  siteurl: 'http://notandrewkaye.github.io/mySecondJekyllSite/'
	  media: 'media'
	  metadata:
	    _posts:
	      - name: "category"
	        field:
	          element: "hidden"
	          value: "blog"
	      - name: "layout"
	        field:
	          element: "hidden"
	          value: "blog"
	      - name: "title"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Title"
	          value: ""
	      - name: "splash"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Splash image"
	          value: ""
	      - name: "tags"
	        field:
	          element: "multiselect"
	          label: "Add Tags"
	          placeholder: "Choose Tags"
	          options:
	            - name: "Apples"
	              value: "apples"
	            - name: "Bananas"
	              value: "bananas"
	            - name: "Pears"
	              value: "pears"
	            - name: "Mangos"
	              value: "mangos"
	    _posts/static:
	      - name: "layout"
	        field:
	          element: "hidden"
	          value: "page"
	      - name: "title"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Title"
	          value: ""
	      - name: "permalink"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Permalink"
	          value: ""


Each of these parameters can be customized to fit your site needs. We'll discuss some of these in class and explore how elements and values play into getting the most out of Prose.

###Configuration options:

####**Form field attributes**

**Text**

	element: text
	label: (optional string) Label to the user
	help: (optional string) Help/description to accompany a label
	value: (optional string) A default value
	placeholder: (optional string) Helper text in the input if no value is provided.
	type: text

**Textarea**

	element: textarea
	label: (optional string) Label to the user
	help: (optional string) Help/description to accompany a label
	value: (optional string) A default value
	placeholder: (optional string) Helper text in the textarea if no value is provided.

**Select & Multiselect**

Allow a user to make one or more selections

	element: select OR multiselect
	label: (optional string) Label to the user
	help: (optional string) Help/description to accompany a label
	options: (array or string) If the value is a string prose expects this to be a JSONP file that links to a json file structured in the following format: {"name": "Granny Apples", "value": "granny-apples" } if this is an array the formal should look like:
	options:
	  - name: 'Granny Apples'
	    value: 'granny-apples'
	placeholder: (optional string) Helper text if no value is provided

**Hidden**

This is particularly useful for frontmatter fields that should always have a fixed value and not changed. An good example is the layout field a file inherits.

	element: hidden
	value: (optional string) The default value

	element: number
	label: (optional string) Label to the user
	help: (optional string) Help/description to accompany a label
	value: (optional integer) A default integer
	type: number

**Button**

A button can be used to toggle on and off the value

	element: button
	label: (optional string) Label to the user
	help: (optional string) Help/description to accompany a label
	on: (string) The name of the on value
	off: (string) The name of the off value

**Checkbox**

Toggles on a true or false state

	element: checkbox
	label: (optional string) Label to the user
	help: (optional string) Help/description to accompany a label

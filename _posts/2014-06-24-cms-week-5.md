##Integrating Prose

[Prose](http://prose.io) is a GUI in-browser editor for posts on Jekyll sites. It uses your github login to access your site and allows you or other users to add new posts, edit existing posts, and execute many other great functions all from within a browser window. No code required. 

The first step is to authenticate your github account with Prose. Once authenticated, you should see your repositories populate within the Prose window. Prose brings the simplicity of an in browser dashboard like Wordpress to your Jekyll site. 

Select your website and browse your folders and posts, you should be able to see the content you've added so far. 

Prose gives you full access to the post's YAML header so you can categorize, tag, and add just about any functionality. 

To get our site set up with Prose we need to add some standard pieces of code to our _config.yml file. Here's what you need to get started:

	prose:
	  rooturl: '_posts'
	  siteurl: 'http://notandrewkaye.github.io/mySecondJekyllSite/'
	  media: 'media'
	  metadata:
	    _posts:
	      - name: "category"
	        field:
	          element: "hidden"
	          value: "blog"
	      - name: "layout"
	        field:
	          element: "hidden"
	          value: "blog"
	      - name: "title"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Title"
	          value: ""
	      - name: "splash"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Splash image"
	          value: ""
	      - name: "tags"
	        field:
	          element: "multiselect"
	          label: "Add Tags"
	          placeholder: "Choose Tags"
	          options:
	            - name: "Apples"
	              value: "apples"
	            - name: "Bananas"
	              value: "bananas"
	            - name: "Pears"
	              value: "pears"
	            - name: "Mangos"
	              value: "mangos"
	    _posts/static:
	      - name: "layout"
	        field:
	          element: "hidden"
	          value: "page"
	      - name: "title"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Title"
	          value: ""
	      - name: "permalink"
	        field:
	          element: "text"
	          label: "Permalink"
	          value: ""


Each of these parameters can be customized to fit your site needs. We'll discuss some of these in class and explore how elements and values play into getting the most out of Prose.

We'll be going through the process of converting a static HTML site into a Wordpress theme. We'll begin with a responsive site built using HTML5 and CSS3. Download the Responsiive Site from [www.initializr.com](http://initializr.com).

The links below should serve as helpful resources. You certainly DO NOT need to go through everything listed below. I'm providing links to multiple tutorials to illustrate 1. the amount of great resources on the web and 2. the various ways to build a WP theme.

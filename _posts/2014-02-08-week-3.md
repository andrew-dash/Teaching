### Steps to our first Wordpress theme

We'll be going through the process of converting a static HTML site into a Wordpress theme. The links below should serve as helpful resources. You certainly DO NOT need to go through everything listed below. I'm providing links to many tutorial to illustrate 1. the amount of great resources on the web and 2. the various ways to build a WP theme. Before class <small>(hopefully by Wednesday 10/16!)</small> I'll upload the files/ guide I customized for our class.

## Using a remote PHPMyAdmin Panel

To access a server without PHPMyAdmin can simply be accomplished by using a local panel like the one that comes with MAMP. To do this you'll just need to modify the `config.inc.php` file located in the `MAMP/phpmyadmin` folder. Here are the settings that need changed: 

	$i++;
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']          = '';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port']          = '';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket']        = '';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type']  = 'tcp';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension']     = 'mysql';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['compress']      = FALSE;
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'config';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']          = 'username';
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = 'password';

### Review

Looking at the past nine weeks, what have we covered? Where can we go next? What else is there to learn?

### Plugins & Beyond

Wordpress Plugin are great resources but remember a few key factors... Always check how many times the plugins have been downloaded. More downloads generally correlate with reliable plugins. Always begin with trusted resources like the [Wordpress Codex](http://wordpress.org/plugins/) or other reputable sites. Some plugins can be found through simple Google searches, but remember: if it seems too good to be true, most times it is. 

Here are some plugins I keep in mind when building a WordPress Site:

### Anything Else?

Remember when updating your WordPress installation you should always back up your files! Try to update manually, rather than using the auto-update feature. Following the setps in [this guide](http://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress) will give you a straightforward approach to an update. 

Also, always remember to comment code when making changes! You never know when you might return to a change and forget what you changed.

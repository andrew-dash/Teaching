###Now we'll actually install jekyll locally. 

* Installing jekyll locally allows us to build and serve our sites - the same thing that github does with it's GitHub Pages platform. 
* Running `jekyll build` compiles all of the files you set up to construct your site and creates a static HTML site inside a folder called `_site`. 
* The `_site` folder is what Github serves - it is what you see when you navigate to your repository URL. 
* Running the command, `jekyll serve` will host your jekyll site at http://localhost:4000

###Now we'll actually install jekyll locally. 

* Installing jekyll locally allows us to build and serve our sites - the same thing that github does with it's GitHub Pages platform. 
* Running `jekyll build` compiles all of the files you set up to construct your site and creates a static HTML site inside a folder called `_site`. 
* The `_site` folder is what Github serves - it is what you see when you navigate to your repository URL. 
* Running the command, `jekyll serve` will host your jekyll site at http://localhost:4000

**Terminal Commands:**

* `cd` - change directory, use this to move to another folder
* `ls` - list files, lists the files in the current directory
* `pwd` - print working directory, shows your current location
* `sudo` - command to execute at an administrative level
* `jekyll build` - builds jekyll site
* `jekyll serve` - serves the site to http://localhost:4000

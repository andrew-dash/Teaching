###Now we'll actually install jekyll locally. 

* Installing jekyll locally allows us to build and serve our sites - the same thing that github does with it's GitHub Pages platform. 
* Running `jekyll build` compiles all of the files you set up to construct your site and creates a static HTML site inside a folder called `_site`. 
* The `_site` folder is what Github serves - it is what you see when you navigate to your repository URL. 
* Running the command, `jekyll serve` will host your jekyll site at http://localhost:4000

Installing Jekyll

* Jekyll runs using Ruby - We have to set it up in the terminal
* First command is `sudo gem update --system`
* Next, `sudo gem install jekyll`
* Next, `sudo gem install rdiscount`
* Next, `sudo easy_install Pygments`

Jekyll, like static sites we're used to dealing with, uses folders for structure. We begin with three folders: `_includes` `_layout` & `_posts`

We also need a configuration file, `_config.yml`

Type `jekyll` into the terminal (NOTE: you must be in your site's directory) -- you should see a 'complete' message if all went according to plan

Jekyll commands:

* `jekyll build` -This builds the site
* `jekyll serve` -This serves the site to `http://localhost:4000`

Things we might need in order to get this installed:

* `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`
* `brew tap --repair`
* `brew doctor`
* `sudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local`
* `sudo chmod -R g+w /usr/local`
* `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
* `rvm install 1.9.3 --with-gcc=clang`

###Posts, Loops, & Conditionals

Post take a standard format to keep content organized and easy to manage: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

**Loops** are used to check for posts and fill the page with your content. 

A Loop generally looks like this: 

![For Loop](media/first.png)


Use [Liquid Markup](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) to introduce these dynamic elements like a for loop. 

An if statement can be used to customize the way content is displayed. Using tags in the `YAML` header is a great way to filter posts on certain pages. Tags can be added to any post or page by adding a line like: `tag: myTag` to the `YAML` header.

To make certain posts tagged appear on a specific page use an if statement combined with a for loop. It should look something like this:
